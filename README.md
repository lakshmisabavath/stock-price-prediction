# stock-price-prediction
This project involves building a predictive model for forecasting stock prices using historical data and regression techniques. The model leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the future direction of stock prices based on past market trends. It demonstrates how regression techniques like linear and polynomial regression can be applied to time-series data for stock price prediction.

Technologies Used:

Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared historical stock data for modeling, including handling missing values, scaling, and normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualizations like line plots and correlation matrices to understand trends, relationships, and patterns in the data.

Model Building: Applied linear regression and polynomial regression algorithms to predict stock prices.

Feature Engineering: Created new features based on the available stock data to improve the model's predictive power.

Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess the model's performance.

Visualization: Visualized predictions vs. actual stock prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better model understanding and validation.
